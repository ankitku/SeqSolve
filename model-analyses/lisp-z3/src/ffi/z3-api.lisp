#|
In contrast to #Z3_mk_context_rc, the life time of \c Z3_ast objects
are determined by the scope level of #Z3_solver_push and #Z3_solver_pop.
In other words, a \c Z3_ast object remains valid until there is a
call to #Z3_solver_pop that takes the current scope below the level where
the object was created.

Note that all other reference counted objects, including \c Z3_model,
\c Z3_solver, \c Z3_func_interp have to be managed by the caller.
Their reference counts are not handled by the context.

Further remarks:
- \c Z3_sort, \c Z3_func_decl, \c Z3_app, \c Z3_pattern are \c Z3_ast's.
- Z3 uses hash-consing, i.e., when the same \c Z3_ast is created twice,
Z3 will return the same pointer twice.

;; Tactics and Probes

;; ...

;; Solvers

#|
 If the solver is used in a non incremental way (i.e. no calls to
#Z3_solver_push() or #Z3_solver_pop(), and no calls to
#Z3_solver_assert() or #Z3_solver_assert_and_track() after checking
satisfiability without an intervening #Z3_solver_reset()) then solver1
will be used. This solver will apply Z3's "default" tactic.

The "default" tactic will attempt to probe the logic used by the
assertions and will apply a specialized tactic if one is supported.
Otherwise the general `(and-then simplify smt)` tactic will be used.

If the solver is used in an incremental way then the combined solver
will switch to using solver2 (which behaves similarly to the general
"smt" tactic).

Note however it is possible to set the `solver2_timeout`,
`solver2_unknown`, and `ignore_solver1` parameters of the combined
solver to change its behaviour.

The function #Z3_solver_get_model retrieves a model if the
assertions is satisfiable (i.e., the result is \c
Z3_L_TRUE) and model construction is enabled.
The function #Z3_solver_get_model can also be used even
if the result is \c Z3_L_UNDEF, but the returned model
is not guaranteed to satisfy quantified assertions.

\remark User must use #Z3_solver_inc_ref and #Z3_solver_dec_ref to manage solver objects.

(defcfun "Z3_get_implied_equalities" lbool
  "Retrieve congruence class representatives for terms."
  #|
  The function can be used for relying on Z3 to identify equal terms under the current
  set of assumptions. The array of terms and array of class identifiers should have
  the same length. The class identifiers are numerals that are assigned to the same
  value for their corresponding terms if the current context forces the terms to be
  equal. You cannot deduce that terms corresponding to different numerals must be all different,
  (especially when using non-convex theories).
  All implied equalities are returned by this call.
  This means that two terms map to the same class identifier if and only if
  the current context implies that they are equal.

  A side-effect of the function is a satisfiability check on the assertions on the solver that is passed in.
  The function return \c Z3_L_FALSE if the current assertions are not satisfiable.

  #|
  The third argument is a vector of variables that may be used for cubing.
  The contents of the vector is only used in the first call. The initial list of variables
  is used in subsequent calls until it returns the unsatisfiable cube. 
  The vector is modified to contain a set of Autarky variables that occur in clauses that
  are affected by the (last literal in the) cube. These variables could be used by a different
  cuber (on a different solver object) for further recursive cubing. 

  The last argument is a backtracking level. It instructs the cube process to backtrack below
  the indicated level for the next cube.
